The way my app works:

The first screen is in charge of letting the user search for movies.
Text Input is displayed in the first screen. When you click on the text input you can start searching for movies and a list of movies should start apparing in the screen. When your movies is displayed you can click on the movie and it will display you the second screen which is in charge of displaying the details of the movie that you clicked on.

Second Screen:
Poster is shown from the movie, the title, year, rated, runtime, imdb rating, actors, and genre are displayed on the second screen.
On the top left there you can click on back and it will direct you back to the first screen. Or you can just swipe to the right and it will also disply you to the frist screen.
